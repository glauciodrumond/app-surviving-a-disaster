![image](2210.jpg)

Welcome to this Data Science project app. With the data gathered
from the Titanic disaster, using Machine Learning, 
it is possible to predict whether a passenger survives or not.

In a Kaggle competition, the algorithm used in this 
application predicted with almost 80% accuracy whether 
the passenger survived or not.

So, this app is to predict if a person were in titanic would survive or not. 

# How to use it
